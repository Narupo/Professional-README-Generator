  ## Installation
  First, clone the respository onto your local PC. This can be done by using the "Code" dropdown menu within the github repository and adding the SSH link to your clipboard. Once you have done this, open VS Code and use the terminal to navigate to the directory you would like to work in. Once in the directory, in the VS Code terminal type "git clone (paste SSH link here)" and then hit enter. Now you should have most of the necessary files to run the application within your desired directory. Once you have finished cloning the repository, run an intergrated terminal on the index.js. This can be done by right clicking "index.js" and selecting "Open in intergrated terminal". Once within your new intergrated terminal, run "npm install". This will install the rest of the necessary files and dependencies to run the program.

  ## Usage
  Once you have finished the installation process you will be ready to use the application. To start the application, type "node index.js" within an intergrated terminal. This will start the program and prompt the user to answer a series of questions. Once you have finished answering all the questions the program will take the data and use it to create a new professional level README within the "files" folder in the application.
